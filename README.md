# Expense tracker

- Built using create-react-app as part of a React course
- Allows users to: 
    - add new expenses through a form component
    - filter expenses by year (2019 - 2023) and month
    - view a list of all expenses within selected month/year

## ToDo
- Eliminate dummy data 
- Wire up the app to persist data in local storage
